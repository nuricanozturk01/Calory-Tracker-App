# Calory-Tracker-App

The Calory Tracker application is a multi-module Android application. With this application, I attempted to implement clean architecture with multiple modules. As a result, the application became easier to test, extend, and understand. I strived to adhere to the SOLID principles as much as possible, aiming for industry-level development. However, due to my limited understanding of inheritance in modular architecture, I may have exceeded the design line in some places. I can rectify this in the near future. Perhaps I can also add automated tests soon.

## Modules

 - core-ui
